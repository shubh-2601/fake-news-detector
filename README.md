ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression
Overview
In today's digital world, misinformation spreads rapidly. This Fake News Detection System helps classify whether a news article is real or fake using Logistic Regression, a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary classification.

Features
âœ… Detects fake and real news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques âœ… Built using Logistic Regression for efficient classification âœ… User-friendly Web UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript âœ… Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to process textual data âœ… Trained on a real-world dataset for high accuracy

Tech Stack
Machine Learning: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy NLP: TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend (optional): Flask/Django (if needed for deployment) How It Works
Data Preprocessing

Load the dataset (e.g., Kaggleâ€™s Fake News dataset) Clean and process text data (removing stop words, punctuation, etc.) Convert text into numerical data using TF-IDF Vectorization Model Training

Train a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn Split data into training and testing sets to evaluate accuracy Tune hyperparameters for better performance
Prediction & Web Interface

User inputs a news article
The model predicts whether it is real or fake
Displays the result in an interactive web interface Dataset Used
Kaggle Fake News Dataset (CSV format with news headlines and labels) Preprocessed using NLP techniques for better accuracy Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Enhance accuracy using Deep Learning (LSTM, Transformers) ðŸ”¹ Deploy using Flask / FastAPI for full-stack integration ðŸ”¹ Improve dataset size for better generalization
ðŸ”¹ Add real-time news scraping for live detection
